## Key sentence
Henry Kissinger, the child **refugee** who rose to become US secretary of state and defined American foreign policy during the 1970s with his strategies to end the Vietnam War, has died. He was 100.
>曾是难民儿童的亨利•基辛格（Henry Kissinger）去世。他在上世纪70年代成为美国国务卿，并以结束越南战争的战略定义了美国的外交政策。他享年100岁。

According to his **realpolitik** **doctrine**, diplomacy and force should be used to achieve balances of power. He had little use for **idealism** in **formulating** foreign policy, setting him **at odds with** human-rights **advocates** in his eight years in office as national security adviser and later as secretary of state, the top US diplomat.
>根据他的现实政治学说，应该使用外交和武力来实现权力平衡。在制定外交政策时，他很少使用理想主义，这使他在担任国家安全顾问和后来担任美国最高外交官国务卿的八年任期内与人权倡导者产生了分歧。

Through a lens "shaped by **pessimism** and a **dim** view of humanity," Kissinger saw the role of policymakers as "not to **steer** the world along some **preordained** path to universal justice, but to pit power against power to **rein** in the **assorted** aggressions of human beings and to try, as best they can, to **avert** disaster," Barry Gewen wrote in *The Inevitability of Tragedy: Henry Kissinger and His World(2020)*.
>巴里·格文（Barry Gewen）在《悲剧的必然性：亨利·基辛格和他的世界》（2020）一书中写道，通过“悲观主义和对人性的悲观看法”塑造的镜头，基辛格认为政策制定者的角色“不是引导世界沿着某种预定的普世正义之路前进，而是让权力对抗权力，遏制人类的各种侵略行为，尽其所能避免灾难”。

"Kissinger's most **salient** **trait**, the one that **underlay** both his personality and his policies, was an intellectual **brilliance** that even his most **ardent** critics **concede**," Walter Isaacson wrote in Kissinger: A Biography(1992). "In casual conversations or at formal meetings, he was able to weave together **nuances** and insights in a manner that brought discussions to a higher plane."
>沃尔特·艾萨克森在《基辛格传》（1992）中写道：“基辛格最突出的特点，也是他个性和政策的基础，是一种智慧的光辉，即使是他最热心的批评者也承认这一点。”“在非正式谈话或正式会议上，他都能把细微差别和见解编织在一起，把讨论带到一个更高的层次。”

Kissinger's place in American society at times **transcended** diplomacy. The **scholarly** statesman who never lost his German accent and wore **trademark** black horn-rimmed glasses **assumed** quasi-cult status in the early 1970s, often overshadowing the **reclusive** Nixon by **rubbing shoulders with** Washington's high-society Georgetown set and dating performers Jill St.John, Candice Bergen and Shirley MacLaine.
>基辛格在美国社会的地位有时超越了外交。这位从未失去德国口音、戴着标志性的黑色角边眼镜的学者政治家在20世纪70年代初获得了近乎狂热的地位，他经常与华盛顿乔治城上流社会的人交往，并与演员吉尔·圣约翰（Jill St.John）、坎迪斯·卑尔根（Candice Bergen）和雪莉·麦克莱恩（Shirley MacLaine）约会，使隐退的尼克松黯然失色。

As Nixon's national security adviser, Kissinger **fashioned** a policy-making process based on secrecy and **exclusion**, **catering to** his boss's **disdain** for **bureaucracy** by **circumventing** the State Department and defense officials. Nixon and Kissinger effectively ran foreign policy from the White House, back-channeling messages to international leaders without informing the offices responsible, according to Isaacson.
>作为尼克松的国家安全顾问，基辛格塑造了一个基于保密和排斥的决策过程，通过避开国务院和国防部官员，迎合了他的老板对官僚主义的蔑视。根据艾萨克森的说法，尼克松和基辛格实际上是在白宫制定外交政策，在不通知相关部门的情况下向国际领导人传递信息。
